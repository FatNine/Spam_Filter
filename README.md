# Spam_Filter
This project is a spam filter module with Machine Learning based on Python using Bayes. This filter use Classic Naive Bayes to classify given mails basing on wether they are spam or not.
This Spam filter use dataset from kaggle to train and test. the dataset contains 5573 email, among them 13% is spam and rest of them is healthy.
you can check they in ``spam.cvs`` file.
# Naive Bayes
In machine learning, naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.
Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector

 representing some n features (independent variables), it assigns to this instance probabilities
